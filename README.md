## Overview

This repository contains a React project bootstrapped with  
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
It is provided **strictly for viewing and evaluation purposes only** and may not be used, copied, modified, or redistributed without explicit written permission.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about  
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about  
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.  
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them.  
All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.  
At this point you’re on your own.

You don't ever have to use `eject`.  
The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments.
